Code team chat 4/22/23 notes:
- structure for each battery
    - Voltage
    - 
- have floor value for low
    - raise a flag if a battery is below said floor
- have a ceiling value for *nearly* full/good enough
- for switching array configurations
	- turn all FETs off then enter the new config
	- will need a small delay to make sure everything is delayed before switch
- Run battery discharge test so we can see the differences between OC and loaded terminal voltages.
  If we see a trend, we could plan around it in the system.
- If there is no voltage trend, we know how long it takes to discharge a battery from full, we could use this to estimate when a battery would be low.
- Diodes to prevent back charging when arrays are in parralell with eachother
- Add "black box" for wall charging, control the outputs with two fets on wall charger and two more on the solar charger.
  when wall charging, disable the solar array and enable the wall charger. Then charge each battery indevidually


Changes for charging diagram
	- Add the flags for floor and ceiling
	- poll battery voltages
		- when brake enaged, because the motors are disabled anyways, kill power, poll voltages. 
			- can publish the voltages to a structure or pass to dedicated variables (structure might be neeter)
		1) disconnect everything and measure oc
		2) reference oc vs loaded voltage trend for estimate
	- include FET configuration table 
	- include sleep state for overnight battery conservation
		- if the key truned or button pressed, change state
	

Accelerator array (matt)
	- add details

single array (Keegan)
	- add battery polling
	- wall charger
	- add delay between switching

Polling chart (Tom)
	- made from scratch
